          Each decade highlights one representative look or designer, along with the
          cultural forces that shaped the clothes men wear.

          <p>
            In the 1950s, menswear emphasized stability and respectability.
            Single-breasted suits, narrow lapels, and crisp white shirts were
            wardrobe essentials. This look was popularized by Hollywood icons and
            postwar office culture, reinforcing a clean, controlled image of masculinity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fabrics were structured and often heavy, with muted tones like navy, grey,
            and charcoal dominating. The overall effect was polished but restrictive,
            visually communicating order and discipline.

            The 1970s challenged earlier conservatism with wider lapels, flared trousers,
            and adventurous patterns. Menswear absorbed influences from disco, rock,
            and counterculture, making clothing a more explicit form of self-expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            Synthetic fabrics, saturated colors, and statement collars created dramatic,
            attention-grabbing outfits that reflected shifting social norms around gender,
            freedom, and pleasure.

            The 1980s were defined by extremes. On one side, boxy power suits with
            strong shoulders signaled ambition in corporate spaces. On the other, punk
            and DIY aesthetics tore those structures apart with ripped denim, leather,
            safety pins, and graphic tees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Designers and musicians blurred the line between street and runway, using
            menswear to question authority and push back against traditional ideals.

          <p>
            In the 2010s, streetwear moved from subculture to mainstream luxury.
            Hoodies, sneakers, and relaxed silhouettes became central to menswear,
            often paired with minimalist palettes and tech-inspired fabrics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Social media and global fashion weeks amplified cross-cultural references,
            allowing designers to mix tailoring with sportswear and casual pieces. Menswear
            became more fluid and personal, less tied to strict dress codes.
